    "This game is based on the 1997 book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling. It is the first book of the Harry Potter series. The story revolves around Harry Potter, a young boy who discovers he is a wizard and is sent to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Along with his new friends, Harry uncovers the truth about a dark wizard named Voldemort and the mysterious stone that he seeks. They must succeed in stopping Voldemort by getting the stone before he does, which is a powerful object capable of granting immortality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this game, the player must collect items from Diagon Alley in order to gain access to Hogwarts and find the Sorcerer's Stone. To get the Sorcerer's Stone, a player must defeat the guardian. If a player does not collect the CORRECT and ENOUGH items, they will be unable to defeat the guardian. As a result, the game requires a good understanding of the book in order to figure out which items to pick. There are 4 stages that should be completed in less than 3 minutes.\n",
