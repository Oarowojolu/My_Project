    "About the Game \n",
    "\n",
    "This code is a revision of my first game. I have changed the game slightly to take into consideration the user experience, creativity and replay value. The game simulates a visit to Ollivander's Wand Shop in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. In the first step, the code asks the user to choose a wand, and then plays three games - guessing a random number between 1 and 5, guessing a random Harry Potter character, and spell. The code checks if the player has chosen the correct wand, guessed the correct number, guessed the correct Harry Potter character, and spell. If they have correctly guessed all four, it means that the wand has chosen them otherwise the player is prompted to play again. \n",
    "The game is interactive, engaging, and provides a fun way for Harry Potter fans to learn about different wands, characters, and spells from the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Highlighted below are the specific adjustments made in this Version that were not in the first game\n",
    "\n",
    "i)Added try/except blocks around the input statements to handle errors from user input.\n",
    "ii)Added prompt parameter to all input() calls to improve readability.\n",
    "iii)Added random module to add more randomness to the game.\n",
    "iv)Added more depth to the choices by accepting more than one word/number inputs using casefold() method and in syntax.\n",
    "v)Used case control methods (lower()) to handle variations in user input.\n",
    "vi)Fixed navigation bugs where the game would end after 3 wrong entries and where the game would end in either choices.\n",
    "vii)Fixed capitalization bugs"
